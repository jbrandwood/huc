;
; This is the initialization code in the 1st bank, and it is responsible for
; setting up a consistant runtime environment for the developer's program,
; so that the developer can concentrate on writing the program itself.
;
; The idea is that when a program is loaded, the first 40KB of it is mapped
; as $4000..$DFFF, and initialization starts at $4000, with the developer's
; program getting control after initialization, with a jump to "core_main".
;
; The initializtion sets up a small kernel of code that provides interrupt
; handling that mimics a subset of the System Card's behavior, designed to
; act in the same way on HuCARD and CD-ROM, with either the System Card in
; MPR7, or with an overlay in MPR7.
;
; The kernel handles reading the joypad/mouse, and it offers handler hooks
; for running the developer's interrupt code.  On CD-ROM systems, it also
; handles the loading and running of subsequent overlay programs.
;
; On HuCARD, the kernel itself runs in MPR7; while on CD-ROM systems it is
; run from RAM in MPR1, so that overlay programs are independant from each
; other, and can be written in different programming languages.
;
;
; 1) If we're running on a HuCARD, the initialization is simple!
;
;    The PC Engine's memory map is set to ...
;
;      MPR0 = bank $FF : PCE hardware
;      MPR1 = bank $F8 : PCE RAM with Stack & ZP
;      MPR2 = bank $00 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR3 = bank $01 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR4 = bank $02 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR5 = bank $03 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR6 = bank $04 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR7 = bank $00 : HuCARD ROM
;
;
; 2) If we're running on a HuCARD that supports the Turbo Everdrive, then the
;    first 2 banks are reserved for mapping the TED2 hardware and a RAM bank.
;
;    The PC Engine's memory map is set to ...
;
;      MPR0 = bank $FF : PCE hardware
;      MPR1 = bank $F8 : PCE RAM with Stack & ZP
;      MPR2 = bank $02 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR3 = bank $03 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR4 = bank $04 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR5 = bank $05 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR6 = bank $06 : HuCARD ROM
;      MPR7 = bank $02 : HuCARD ROM
;
;
; 3) If we're running on an old CD System, the overlay is loaded from the ISO
;    into banks $80-$87 (64KB max).
;
;    The PC Engine's memory map is set to ...
;
;      MPR0 = bank $FF : PCE hardware
;      MPR1 = bank $F8 : PCE RAM with Stack & ZP
;      MPR2 = bank $80 : CD RAM
;      MPR3 = bank $81 : CD RAM
;      MPR4 = bank $82 : CD RAM
;      MPR5 = bank $83 : CD RAM
;      MPR6 = bank $84 : CD RAM
;      MPR7 = bank $80 : CD RAM or System Card's bank $00
;
;
; 4) If we're running on a SuperCD System, the overlay is loaded from the ISO
;    into banks $68-$87 (256KB max).
;
;    The PC Engine's memory map is set to ...
;
;      MPR0 = bank $FF : PCE hardware
;      MPR1 = bank $F8 : PCE RAM with Stack & ZP
;      MPR2 = bank $68 : SCD RAM
;      MPR3 = bank $69 : SCD RAM
;      MPR4 = bank $6A : SCD RAM
;      MPR5 = bank $6B : SCD RAM
;      MPR6 = bank $6C : SCD RAM
;      MPR7 = bank $68 : SCD RAM or System Card's bank $00
